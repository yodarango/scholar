-  Seems like I have wrapped up everything. Now move setting up all the Shroody images and
   final css styles where needed

-  ðŸ‘‰ Maybe explore AI stuff
-  Wired up summarization of chapters in read page. Check that I am handling all the unions correctly in the FE

-  Finish Text to image stuff. use chapter ids instead of whole texts

-  Left off in trying to make stability work
