-  Seems like I have wrapped up everything. Now move setting up all the Shroody images and
   final css styles where needed

-  Move the write to disk of image to createimageFrom verse rather than at keep image in the BE. Keep image should only toggle the is_keep to true in DB
-  Handle sending custom prompt
   \_ handle showing user's images in their profile
-  Wired up summarization of chapters in read page. Check that I am handling all the unions correctly in the FE

-  ðŸ§  Seems like image creation and keeping is done. Now make sure you can save it to a users profile
