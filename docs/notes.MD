finished the folder creation, saving, editing and adding post to it process, make sure is coheseive and it all works!

I finished setting up the folders/id page. Needs to be styled and separation of concerns

-  Make the header scrolling responsive (i.e. scroll down hides/ up shows)

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc
