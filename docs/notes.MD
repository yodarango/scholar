finished the folder creation, saving, editing and adding post to it process, make sure is coheseive and it all works!

Currently trying to set up the view list for each folder

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc
