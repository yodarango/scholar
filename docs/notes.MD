## FROM LAST CODING SESSION

-  the last pages touched were register.tsx and login.tsx. I am now handling authentication and redirection based on login status, however, before it redirects, for a quick second, you are able to see the form before it redirects, fix this.

-  Move everything to a child component, as the @me component.
