## FROM LAST CODING SESSION

the las files touched where the general_settings and user_settings.ts
I set up the mutation to for the general settings. However username and
avatar are not currently saved under the general_settings call, each needs its own
call separately and the controller has already been set up in the back end.

Continue working in the user settings calls
