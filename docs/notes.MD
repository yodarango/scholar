last files touched were folder_editor.tsx, use_save_folder.ts, user_get_folder.ts, /folders/new/[id].tsx and /folders/edit/index.tsx .

too tired to figure it out but essesnitally i need a posting hook to the folder edit and new folder calls.

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc
