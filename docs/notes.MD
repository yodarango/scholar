-  update all refs to /uses/folders/ to /users/<id>/folders

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc

ðŸ‘‰ Left off in the reading page. I am now pulling stickers for all commentaries. Set a folder for sticker folders and make the stickers.
ðŸ‘‰ finish the sticker_chooser.tsx

-  I have added sticker component to edit/commentary textEditor but without functionality yet
-  add it to create new post too
