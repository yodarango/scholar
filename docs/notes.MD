finished the folder creation, saving, editing and adding post to it process, make sure is cohesive and it all works!

-  add delete all and remove all posts to the folder id
-  I added the seletion folder, make it a helper, too much work to not be a helper
-  set up the back end
-  update all refs to /uses/folders/ to /users/<id>/folders

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc
