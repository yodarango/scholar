-  update all refs to /uses/folders/ to /users/<id>/folders

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc

✅ I have basically finished all auth.
⛔️❓😬 I got rid of all the isSelfs. Make sure everything is working
👉 remove them in the BE too
👉 In the Back end check commentary folder and make sure it is not returning private folders
👉 the back end is assigning the user signature as MYUSER? check why
