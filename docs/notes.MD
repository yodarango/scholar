-  update all refs to /uses/folders/ to /users/<id>/folders

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc

I have fixed the middleware and I have set it up for all routes that need it.
ðŸ‘‰ I have basically finished all auth.
ðŸ‘‰ next, make sure that getting the data is correct (i. e. isSelf vs user_id etc)
Also finish about_me page to show fail or success notifications
