-  last files touched were me.tsx and about me.tsx.
-  about_me.tsx is working as it is supposed to. The [id] file should be dynamic. if the router.query.id === @me send the itsSelf argument to the db and if not send the ID (update: fixed this but not working)

also user stats is not working. make sure everything as a whole works
