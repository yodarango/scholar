last file touched was commentaries_w_filter.tsx

Currently the headers are not set according the router changes. Fix this so that the correct drop downs and links appear.

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc
