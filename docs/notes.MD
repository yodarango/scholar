-  ðŸ‘‰ Continue adding shrewdy images where needed. I have started creating the necessary components under /common/feedback/mascot_feedback. Let off in select empty bookmarks
-  ðŸ‘‰ I am currently adding the error graphics wherever needed. About done in wigo, the only thing left is the voting polls
-  Maybe explore AI stuff
