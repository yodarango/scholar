last files touched were the get_folders.ts, folders.js, commentary_w_filters.tsx and commentary_grid.tsx

-  I am pulling the commentaries by book from the db but I should not be mixing folders with commentary type.
-  make a folders folder perhaps or a folders modal that is concerned with only pulling folders.
-  everything in the back end is also set to pull folders.
