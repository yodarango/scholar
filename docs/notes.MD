-  update all refs to /uses/folders/ to /users/<id>/folders

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc

ðŸ‘‰ Left off in the reading page. I am now pulling stickers for all commentaries. Set a folder for sticker folders and make the stickers.

-  set the sticker field in new commentary
-  bring up a modal when user clicks on the sticker. It can be the text and category only and then show a link that says see the entire post or something like that or just shw the entire commentary modal ? Idk yet
