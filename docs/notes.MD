finished the folder creation, saving, editing and adding post to it process, make sure is cohesive and it all works!

-  add delete all and remove all posts to the folder id page

Also might want to restructure the routes. Maybe remove /users and do /@me instead. Example /@me/folders, /@me/settings, /@me/about etc
